### **Project Overview**  
This project enhances the **xv6 Operating System** by implementing new system calls, advanced scheduling algorithms, and custom threading mechanisms to improve process management and concurrency.  

### **Key Contributions**  
- 🚀 Developed new **system calls**:  
  - `trace`: Controls program tracing.  
  - `history`: Retrieves aggregated system call history.  
- 🛠️ Implemented advanced **scheduling algorithms**:  
  - **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** for dynamic priority scheduling.  
  - **Lottery Scheduling** for fair CPU time distribution.  
- 🔄 Designed and implemented custom **threading and synchronization primitives** to improve concurrency management.  

### **Technical Skills**  
💻 **xv6 Internals, System Calls, Inter-Process Communication (IPC), Scheduling Algorithms, Threading, Synchronization, C, C++, Bash Scripting**
